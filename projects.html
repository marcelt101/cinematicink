  <h2>Screenplays in Production</h2>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li><strong>The Veil</strong> – A spiritual drama about grief, faith, and redemption. When widowed architect Daniel Mercer transforms an abandoned hotel into a refuge for the forgotten, he's drawn into a spiritual battle spanning generations. Guided by a mysterious WWII veteran and protecting a prophetic child from a corrupt archbishop, Daniel discovers that bringing heaven to earth will cost him everything—and that some broken promises can only be redeemed through radical love.</li>

  <h2>Screenplays in Pre-Production</h2>
  <ul class="project-list">
    <li><strong>Unveiled</strong> – In the wake of The Veil, a new chapter unfolds — where hidden promises echo across generations, and the power to heal what was left undone changes everything.</li>
    <li><strong>Eden Cypher</strong> – A psychological sci-fi thriller where an archivist discovers a corrupted memory fragment containing an ancient consciousness, forcing him to descend into a forbidden vault with the sole survivor of a dark experiment to stop humanity from merging into a single mind—a seductive offer of transcendence that would erase what makes us human.</li>
	<li><strong>Resonance</strong> – Five people are accidentally displaced 200 years into the future during a particle collider experiment, arriving in an impossible paradise that becomes their nightmare. Resonance is a psychological thriller exploring humanity's inability to accept the very perfection it claims to desire.</li>
